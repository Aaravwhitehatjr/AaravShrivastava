            </section>

            <p>Hello, my name is Aarav Shrivastava and I was born on 22nd July, 2008 in Bangalore. I have stayed in Bangalore for 10 years and finished my primary studies over there till 5th grade. At the end of January 2019, I shifted to Gurgaon as my dad got promoted to a new company. Also, we shifted to Gurgaon because I used to stay seperately from my dad when I used to stay in Bangalore and we took a plan of staying together instead of staying seperately. After shifting to Gurgaon, I continued my 5th Grade in a school called Pathways School Gurgaon. I am currently studying in 7th grade.

    <p> My favourite author is Francis Scott Fitzgerald. He was an American novelist and a scriptwriter. He was born on 24th September, 1896 in Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States. He wrote his first novel, THE SIDES OF PARADISE, was a great success which made him a famous author. Fitzgerald married Zelda and they both became important figures. They both moved to Paris in the 1920's. Fitzgerald wrote his famous novel, THE GREAT GATSBY, in 1925, which he left incomplete. He left writing novels and moved to Hollywood, where he became a scriptwriter. He died on 21st December, 1940, in Hollywood, California, due to heart attack. </p>

    <p> My Inspiration is Abraham Lincoln, who was the 16th President of the United States of America. He was born on 12th February, 1809 at Larue County, Kentucky. When Abraham was 7 years old, his family moved to Indiana, where his father was a woodchopper. The parents tought the children to stay a moral life. They also told them about slavery. Slavery was a system were black people were treated like properties. Lincoln was passionate on reading and writing. When Lincoln was 22 yrs old, he went to Illinois. He saw there that he took goods from a boat to New Orleans where he saw slavery. People thought that he will abolish slavery. At the age of 23, he was the Captain of the Back Hawk war and ran the political office for the first time. Losing an election, he became a lawyer and studied law. He ran the office again, but won the election this time and served in the Illinois House of Representatives. After he was running the Illinois house of representatives, he wanted to run the whole USA house representatives. But, he lost and was able to serve a 2-year term. He ran the US Senate against Stephen Doughlas. His debates with him are considered the best debates in American History. The debate made Abraham Lincoln famous and the campaign made him go for the Presidency for the USA. Lincoln ran for president and won the 1861 elections. That made him the 16th President of the USA. When Lincoln became President, US was divided into issues, like slavery. The south was beginning to split away from USA, and this was known as the American Civil War, the bloodiest war in American History. The South made a states called The Confederate States of America, and the Civil war started in 1861 and went on for 4 yrs. Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, which was on freeing the slaves. While the Civil War was happening, Abraham made a famous speech known as the GETTYSBURG ADDRESS. 2 yrs, the union won the Civil Wat, and the joy was short. On April 14th 1865, an actor known as John Wilkes Booth, who was very angry on Abraham Lincoln, assasinated Abraham Lincoln in the Presidency box of Fords Theatre in Wshington, at the night. </p>
